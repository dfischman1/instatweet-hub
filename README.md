Project Description:
Roundtable is a social networking website that intends to provide a place for any community   to update the world through photos and text. Though many companies maintain    Facebook pages, Instagram and Twitter accounts, etc, there is no centralized   feed for a company/business/group/assocation to put everything. Our product    aims to have users register with specific Instagram/Twitter handles and hashtags. After registering users simply post pictures and tweets with the account and hashtags they have registered and our website will produce a live feed of the media. This makes the task of maintaing a page with written and photographic media easy. Any registered member of a company from the mailman to the CEO can easily contribute to the page. We hope to have many Roundtable pages on our website, but we imagine that some companies might want to put their Roundtablepage on their official website. Eventually we hope to allow users to register with our website and then simply use our code to embed their Roundtable page into their official website similar to how users of Disqus use the commenting service on various sites. 

Group members: Leopold Spohngellert, Daniel Teehan, Daelin Fischman, and Patrick So
