What do we hope to accomplish by Friday?
a plan for using the apis with a proof of campus and some basic html skeleton.

Update: We are now aiming to set up our registration system including data management for usernames, twitter handles, instagram handles, and hashtag selections. This also includes designing the homepage and registration page HTML/styling and taking care of the app.py side of registration. Once we have a clean registration page we can move on and start setting up the meat of our project.
